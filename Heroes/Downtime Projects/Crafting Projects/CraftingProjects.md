# Crafting Projects 

Crafting projects enable heroes to create vehicles, supernatural treasures, and more. When you start a crafting project, other creatures can also work on the project, using their respite activity to contribute a project roll in order to get the work done faster. Unless a project has a event table of its own, the Director uses the Crafting and Research Events table for crafting project events.
